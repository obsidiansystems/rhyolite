# Revision history for Rhyolite

This project's release branch is `master`. This log is written from the perspective of the release branch: when changes hit `master`, they are considered released, and the date should reflect that release.

## v1.0.0.0 2023-08-03
* Breaking: Drop groundhog support
* Breaking: Use Commutative from commutative-semigroups instead of Additive from patch
* Update to vessel-0.3
* Support ghc-8.10
* Add Data.Vessel.Void
* Move .obelisk/impl to dep/obelisk
* Breaking: handleAuthMapQuery and handlePersonalAuthMapQuery now take pure functions for decrypting user
  tokens. This is fine in practice because it should almost always be readSignedWithKey from signed-data,
  partially applied to a CSK. We had a major performance issue when someone stuck a database query inside
  the function, and it ran in a loop for every connected user on every database notification, so we want
  to defend against that sort of thing happening. There may still be legitimate reasons to do other IO
  inside such a thing (e.g. if a different encryption mechanism were used), but if that's needed, we'll
  reconsider the API further.

## 2023-01-26
* Breaking: Rhyolite.Frontend.Cookie now always Base64 encodes cookies
* change taskWorker to not manage the hasRun flag.  For the old behavior, use `taskWorker1` which adds back the at-most-once execution behavior.  The old `_task_hasRun` field of Task is a separate argument.
* Task type no longer uses lenses for field accessors.  use field labels or regular functions instead.
* Fix `Rhyolite.DB.Beam.current_timestamp_` for PostgreSQL server instances whose time zone is *not* set to UTC.
* Add helper types for beam code, namely `WrapColumnar` and `WrapNullable`.
* Add beam orphan instances for some functor types, such as `Product` and `Proxy`.
* Bump obelisk 1.0.0.0 and reflex-platform (0.9.2.0)
* Add rhyolite-account-types and rhyolite-account-backend for use with beam-based rhyolite projects
  * Moved groundhog-legacy's `Rhyolite.Account` module to `Rhyolite.Account.Groundhog.Types`
* Added Beam versions of `Rhyolite.Task.Groundhog.Worker.taskWorker` and `Rhyolite.Task.Groundhog.Task`, in `Rhyolite.Task.Groundhog.Worker` and `Rhyolite.Task.Beam` respectively.
* Removed `Rhyolite.Request.Common`, now using functions from Aeson directly. Use `decode'` instead of `decodeValue'`.
* Bump vessel to 0.2.1.0 (pre-release)
* Add mapAuthenticatedV
* Extend AuthenticatedV to have a personal view component in addition to private and public ones. Personal views are similar to private ones
  in that they require a token to access, but are computed separately per-user.
  They're specifically for the case that we expect different users' views to have nothing in common with one another.

* Breaking changes:
  * Rename `Rhyolite.Frontend.App.openWebSocket'` to `openWebSocket` and remove the previous definition of `openWebSocket`. To get the same output as before: `(_appWebSocket_notification x, _appWebSocket_response x)`.
  * Remove the `rhyolite-backend-snap` package. It has been released as [snap-stream](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/snap-stream). Use that package instead.
  * Remove the `backend-db` package. See the [groundhog-legacy migration guide](groundhog-legacy/README.md) and the notes below:
    * Remove `Rhyolite.Backend.DB.PsqlSimple.Orphans`. Changes have been moved our fork of [postgresql-simple](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/postgresql-simple).
    * Rename `PostgresRaw` to `Psql` and move it to `psql-simple-class`.
    * Move Psql (formerly PostgresRaw) instance for groundhog's `DbPersist` to psql-simple-groundhog.
    * Remove `fromIdRow` from `Rhyolite.Backend.DB.PsqlSimple`
    * Move `traceQuery` and `traceExecute` to psql-simple-class
    * Use `postgresql-simple-interpolate` for quasiquotated postgresql-simple queries. The following function names have changed:
      * queryQ -> iquery
      * executeQ -> iexecute
      * executeQ_ -> iexecute_
      * traceQueryQ -> itraceQuery (defined in psql-simple-class)
      * traceExecuteQ -> itraceExecute (defined in psql-simple-class)
      * traceExecuteQ_ -> itraceExecute_ (defined in psql-simple-class)
    * Remove `Rhyolite.Backend.DB.PsqlSimple` as all of its functionality has been moved elsewhere.
    * Move instances from `Database.Groundhog.Postgresql.Orphans` to `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.Orphans` in groundhog-legacy.
    * Move `Network.PushNotification.Worker` to `groundhog-legacy` and rename it to `Rhyolite.Network.PushNotification.Worker`.
    * Move `Rhyolite.Backend.DB` to `groundhog-legacy` and rename it to `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog`.
    * Move the `PostgresLargeObject` class to `psql-simple-class` and move its groundhog-based instances to `groundhog-legacy`.
      * `withStreamedLargeObject` no longer requires groundhog, but does require a connection. Use `liftWithConn` to use it with groundhog.
    * Move `Rhyolite.Backend.DB.Serializable` to `Database.PostgreSQL.Serializable` in `psql-serializable` and move its groundhog-based instances to `groundhog-legacy`'s `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.Serializable` module.
    * Move `Rhyolite.Backend.Schema` and `Rhyolite.Backend.Schema.Class` to `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.Schema` and `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.Schema.Class` in `groundhog-legacy`.
    * Move `Rhyolite.Schema.Task` and `Rhyolite.Backend.Schema.Task` to `Rhyolite.Task.Groundhog`, and move `Rhyolite.Backend.TaskWorker` to `Rhyolite.Task.Groundhog.Worker`, both in `groundhog-legacy`.
    * Move `Rhyolite.Backend.Schema.TH` to `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.TH` in `groundhog-legacy`.
  * Remove `Rhyolite.Map.Monoidal`. For `=:` use `Data.Map.Monoidal.singleton` instead, and for `restrictKeys` use monoidal-containers >= 0.6.1.0.
  * Remove rhyolite-aeson-orphans. It has been renamed and moved to [bytestring-aeson-orphans](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/bytestring-aeson-orphans) and is now used as a dependency.
    * Remove the aeson orphan instances for Alt, Any and Down.
  * Move `Rhyolite.Backend.Listen` to its own project `rhyolite-notify-listen`. The module is now called `Rhyolite.DB.NotifyListen`. `insertAndNotify` and related classes and functions can now be found in the groundhog-legacy package in the `Rhyolite.DB.NotifyListen.Groundhog` module, and in `notify-listen-beam` for beam versions. The various `notify` functions now require `Psql m`.
  * Remove Rhyolite.HList.
  * Remove Data.MonoidMap. It has been moved to [monoid-map](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/monoid-map) and is now used as a dependency.
  * Narrow the type of `signWithKey` so that the input type matches the output's phantom type parameter.
  * Move `Rhyolite.Backend.Email` and `Rhyolite.Email` to `Rhyolite.Email` in the new `rhyolite-email` package.
    * Provide more error information in the interface for sending an email in `rhyolite-email`.
    * The `EmailEnv` type has been changed to `EmailConfig`, which is a structured record type instead of a flat tuple.
  * Move `LargeObjectId` to `psql-simple-class`.
  * Remove the `Rhyolite.TH` module. Use `file-embed` instead.
  * Move `Rhyolite.Backend.EmailWorker` to `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.EmailWorker` in `groundhog-legacy`. Change the schema for `QueuedEmail` to contain a JSON blob of the `Mail` object instead of the rendered email bytestring. See the groundhog-legacy migration guide for more information.
  * Move the `Account` type to `groundhog-legacy-types` and move associated backend functionality to `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.Account` in `groundhog-legacy`.
  * Move `Signed` and `MonadSign` to `signed-data`. Move `signWithKey`, `readSignedWithKey`, `SignT`, etc to `signed-data-clientsession`. Move groundhog instances for `MonadSign` and `SignT` to `Rhyolite.DB.Groundhog.Orphans`.
  * Move `Account` to `groundhog-legacy-types`. Move backend code for accounts, e.g., `ensureAccountExists` to `Rhyolite.Account.Groundhog` in `groundhog-legacy`.
  * Move `Rhyolite.Schema` to `groundhog-legacy-types`.
  * Rename `datastructures` to `semimap` since it only contains SemiMap.
  * Move `Rhyolite.Frontend.Widget`, `Rhyolite.Frontend.Form`, and `Rhyolite.Frontend.Modal.*` to `rhyolite-widgets`.
* New:
  * Add a `Psql` instance for beam's `Pg`
* Version bumps:
  * vessel 0.2.0.0

## 2021-11-18

* Fixed a bug in `handleAuthMapQuery` where tokens were always validated

## 2021-11-16
* Rhyolite.Concurrent: add taggedWorker to make it easier to determine the source of error messages
* Bump groundhog
* Bump obelisk (develop as of 2021-04-19) and reflex-platform (0.7.1.0)
* Remove rhyolite-logging and use monad-logger-extras in rhyolite-db instead. `LoggingEnv` is replaced by `Logger`.
* Remove `runPrerenderedRhyoliteWidget`. Use `runRhyoliteWidget` instead.
* `runObeliskRhyoliteWidget` now also returns a Dynamic `AppWebSocket`.
* Emails
  * separate build and send for widget email
  * Update widget emails for newer routes.
  * Use a record for email configuration.
  * Add a function for email with a StaticWidget
* Simple authenticated queries
  * `ErrorV` vessel captures logic for possibly failing queries
  * `AuthMapV` gathers queries associated to different identities so that they can be processed together.
  * `AuthenticatedV` distinguishes between public queries that need no authentication and private queries which do.

## 2020-04-28

* Bump Obelisk to version 0.8 which includes a bump to reflex-platform and nixpkgs 19.09

## 2020-01-10

* Add `mapModalTM`, `mapModalT` and `mapModalTM` functions for changing the underlying monads of `ModalT`.
* Fix bug in `functorToWire` causing `SelectedCount` of `0` to be considered non-mempty.
* Fix regression in rhyolite-frontend so that it builds in GHCJS again

## 2019-12-20

* Move `Rhyolite.Backend.Logging` to its own project `rhyolite-logging` and re-export.
* Add `Rhyolite.Backend.DB.Serializable` for doing PostgreSQL transactions in `SERIALIZABLE` isolation with automatic retrying on serialization errors.
* *Breaking change*: Switch `runDb` to use the `Serializable` monad for all transactions. This monad is not a transformer and has very few instances. Notably, lifting `IO` into it must be done *manually*, and only with great care.
* Add `runDbReadOnlyRepeatableRead` to `RunDb` to make streaming reads easier. Notably, this transaction mode allows `MonadIO` because it will never retry.
* Fix thread-safety bug in `firebaseWorker`.
* *Breaking change*: Rework `MonadSign` to look a lot more like `MonadReader` so that its instances can more easily avoid `MonadIO`.
* *Breaking change*: Functions in `Rhyolite.Backend.EmailWorker` now have a constraint requiring that `Serializable` be the base monad.
* Add `PostgresRaw` and `PostgresLargeObject` instances to `SignT`.
* Bump `postgresql-simple` to avoid `WARNING: There is no transaction in progress` when there is a serialization error.

## 2019-10-20

* Deprecated runPrerenderedRhyoliteWidget, use runRhyoliteWidget instead.
* Use GHC 8.6. This necessitated bumps to
    * dependent-sum-aeson-orphans
    * gargoyle
    * groundhog
    * obelisk
    * postgresql-lo-stream
    * reflex-platform
    * vessel
* Convert many places using `fail` to use `error` directly to avoid `MonadFail` constraint
* Remove many instances from `Backend.DB.PsqlSimple.Orphans` that were upstreamed to `postgresql-simple`

## 2019-08-27

* Improve error message on parse failure in certain database instances

## 2019-08-19

* Added `runObeliskRhyoliteWidget` for integration with obelisk applications.

## 2019-08-02

* Remove `Rhyolite.Backend.Snap`. That module has been made obsolete by Obelisk.
* Frontend.App: Use reflex's `matchResponsesWithRequests` instead of `identifyTags` (now deleted). Change the identifier used by `TaggedRequest` and `TaggedResponse` to an `Int`
* Remove `mapRequesterT`. This has been upstreamed to reflex as `withRequesterT`
* Remove Frontend.Request and Frontend.WebSocket

## 2019-08-01

* Use `HasId`, `Id`, and related types/functions from database-id-class and database-id-groundhog. Remove the implementations in Rhyolite.Schema and Rhyolite.Backend.Schema
* Remove Rhyolite.Backend.DB.TH since the code there was redundant with Rhyolite.Backend.Schema.TH
* Convert all dependencies in default.nix to thunks in `dep/`
* Update to use monoidal-containers 0.5
* Add a test that builds all the rhyolite submodules to `test/`
* Remove `withDb`, which can now be found in [gargoyle-postgresql-connect](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/gargoyle/tree/develop/gargoyle-postgresql-connect)

## 2019-06-14

* Add `Rhyolite.Frontend.Modal.*` modules for conveniently creating modals that do not require the use of `z-index` to position correctly.
* Add `withLoggingMinLevel` function in `Rhyolite.Backend.Logging` which allows you to pick the fallback filter when no other filters match.
* Bump obelisk to a version that no longer uses `*Tag` classes.
* Remove the "HasView" and "HasRequest" classes, and the general concept of having a type level "app" identifier. Instead, everything is explicitly parametrised on query and request types directly, and the query type is no longer *required* to be a Functor/Align/etc. so that Vessel becomes an option for defining queries and views.
* Remove the "Request" class, as it has been subsumed by more general machinery. You can use deriveArgDict from constraints-extras and deriveJSONGADT from aeson-gadt-th on your request datatypes to obtain the same powers (and more).
* In its place, there is a Request type synonym which stands for (ForallF ToJSON r, Has ToJSON r, FromJSON (Some r), Has FromJSON r).
* Added standardPipeline as a good example of a last argument you can use for serveDbOverWebsockets, in the case that you have a Functor-style query/view type. It now uses condense/disperse from the Vessel library.
* Added vesselPipeline similarly for the case where you're using a functor-parametric container type (such as Vessel) for your queries and views.
* Added a DiffQuery type class which allows us to specify how queries are subtracted. We were doing this in an ad-hoc fashion based on Align instances before, but the generalisation of query types meant that we could no longer assume this was an option.
* If you have a Functor-style query/view, the 'standardDiffQuery' function can be used to implement the 'DiffQuery' instance for it.
* If you're using Vessel, to implement DiffQuery you can use subtractV which is a consequence of the View typeclass.
* Add alternative to groundhog's `==.`, which has severe performance issues before version 0.10 (to which we can't yet upgrade). See `Rhyolite.Backend.DB.===.`.
* Add `validationDropdown` and `validationTextArea`
  * Add an extra type parameter `v` specifying the widget value type (typically `Text`) to `ValidationConfig`
  * Add `mkValidationConfig` which is like `defValidationConfig` but takes the initial value
  * Add `validationDropdownChangeEvent` that returns the change event of the ValidationDropdown
* Remove the "HasView" and "HasRequest" classes, and the general concept of having a type level "app" identifier. Instead, everything is explicitly parametrised on query and request types directly, and the query type is no longer *required* to be a Functor/Align/etc. so that Vessel becomes an option for defining queries and views.
* Remove the "Request" class, as it has been subsumed by more general machinery. You can use deriveArgDict from constraints-extras and deriveJSONGADT from aeson-gadt-th on your request datatypes to obtain the same powers (and more).
* In its place, there is a Request type synonym which stands for (ForallF ToJSON r, Has ToJSON r, FromJSON (Some r), Has FromJSON r). 
* Added standardPipeline as a good example of a last argument you can use for serveDbOverWebsockets, in the case that you have a Functor-style query/view type. It now uses condense/disperse from the Vessel library.
* Added vesselPipeline similarly for the case where you're using a functor-parametric container type (such as Vessel) for your queries and views.
* Added a DiffQuery type class which allows us to specify how queries are subtracted. We were doing this in an ad-hoc fashion based on Align instances before, but the generalisation of query types meant that we could no longer assume this was an option.
* If you have a Functor-style query/view, the 'standardDiffQuery' function can be used to implement the 'DiffQuery' instance for it.
* If you're using Vessel, to implement DiffQuery you can use subtractV which is a consequence of the View typeclass.
* Bump obelisk to a version that no longer uses `*Tag` classes

## 2019-05-08

* Add NeverNull instance for our Json newtype that encodes things as JSON in the DB.
* Add change-tracking DB notifications. See `HasChangeNotification` in Rhyolite.Backend.Listen.
* Fix bug in `runRhyoliteWidget` and `runPrerenderedRhyoliteWidget` when things were explicitly requested 0 times.
* Fix `mapAuth` to ensure that queries are correctly subtracted from the view selector when switching accounts.
* Add `validationInputWithFeedback` which separates the widget providing feedback on why their input wasn't valid, allowing it to be placed separately in the DOM.
* Create a `RawTask`, useful for jobs where it's inconvenient to track "job complete" separate from the other job ready conditions.

## v0.1.0.0

* Add a server-side worker to handle sending of push notifications
* Disallow using ExceptT and similar monads to host runDb calls
* Add `mapAuth` to rhyolite frontend to allow mapping of application credentials into an "authenticated" subwidget
* Update frontend for obelisk's new hydation feature
* Add Rhyolite.Frontend.Widget to collect useful widgets like `extensibleListWidget` - a widget for editing a list of values
* Add Rhyolite.Frontend.Form, a collection of widgets to help with form validation
* Backend notifications are now typed. This is a breaking change: you'll need to specify your expected notification as a GADT and supply the appropriate GADT constructor when constructing notifications
* Add a worker for handling unqueued tasks that the backend must run. See `Rhyolite.Backend.TaskWorker`
